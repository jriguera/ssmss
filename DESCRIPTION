Simple SMS Send, ssmss is another program to send SMS to mobile phones. 
It is a perl script which can load plugins to extend its functionality. 
Those extensions are a collection of functions which allows you to send 
short messages to any GSM provider through web sites, but is possible 
develop extensions to communicate with other methods. Extensions are 
independent and fully functional ready to be used on other projects.

The program has the ability to detect if the user is on graphic mode or 
text mode. On graphic mode, a GTK-GUI will be launched (only if GTK 
libraries exist, or else text mode).

It has an addressbook and a provider list, so you can configure multiple 
providers, options and select which one you want to use.
