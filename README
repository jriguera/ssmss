Simple SMS Send a.k.a. ssmmss is another program to send SMS to mobile phones. 
It is a perl script which can load plugins to extend its functionality. Those 
extensions are a collection of functions which allows you to send short 
messages to any GSM provider through web sites, but is possible develop 
extensions to communicate with other methods. Extensions are independent and 
fully functional ready to be used on other projects.

The program has the ability to detect if the user is on graphic mode or text 
mode. On graphic mode, a GTK-GUI will be launched (only if GTK libraries exist, 
or else text mode).

It has an addressbook and a provider list, so you can configure multiple 
providers, options and select which one you want to use.
