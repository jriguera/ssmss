Simple SMS Send a.k.a. ssmmss is another program to send SMS to mobile phones. 
It is a perl script which can load plugins to extend its functionality. Those 
extensions are a collection of functions which allows you to send short 
messages to any GSM provider through web sites, but is possible develop 
extensions to communicate with other methods. Extensions are independent and 
fully functional ready to be used on other projects.

The program has the ability to detect if the user is on graphic mode or text 
mode. On graphic mode, a GTK-GUI will be launched (only if GTK libraries exist, 
or else text mode).

It has an addressbook and a provider list, so you can configure multiple 
providers, options and select which one you want to use.


Installation:

The program is called "ssmss" and is a perl script with execution permission.
As a perl script, you need to have perl installed, minimum getopt module,  and 
if you want the GUI, you also need the GTK module.

1. Copy 'ssmss' to '/usr/local/bin'

2. Check permissions (usually '-rwxr-xr-x' and 'root' as owner and group). If 
you do not have these permissions, type in console: 'man chmod' and 'man chown'. 
Once you read this, I think you will be able to do it ... Well, here you are:

	chown root: root ssmss
	chmod 0755 ssmss

3. Create the directory '~/.ssmss' and copy the files 'ssmss.conf' and 
'addressbook.txt' from 'examples' directory to '~/.ssmss'. You can edit those 
files as you wish following the inside instructions.

5. Create '~/.ssmss/modules' and copy in that folder all modules from directory 
'modules' checking permissions. Remember to set up the modules in the 
configuration file '~/.ssmss/ssmss.conf'.

6. Go to rest and reflect on what you've done, just about two hours, although 
some people need four, I think in your case;-) is enough with five.

7. Type 'ssmss' and ...
