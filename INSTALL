Installation:

The program is called "ssmss" and is a perl script with execution permission.
As a perl script, you need to have perl installed, minimum getopt module,  and 
if you want the GUI, you also need the GTK module.

1. Copy 'ssmss' to '/usr/local/bin'

2. Check permissions (usually '-rwxr-xr-x' and 'root' as owner and group). If 
you do not have these permissions, type in console: 'man chmod' and 'man chown'. 
Once you read this, I think you will be able to do it ... Well, here you are:

	chown root: root ssmss
	chmod 0755 ssmss

3. Create the directory '~/.ssmss' and copy the files 'ssmss.conf' and 
'addressbook.txt' from 'examples' directory to '~/.ssmss'. You can edit those 
files as you wish following the inside instructions.

5. Create '~/.ssmss/modules' and copy in that folder all modules from directory 
'modules' checking permissions. Remember to set up the modules in the 
configuration file '~/.ssmss/ssmss.conf'.

6. Go to rest and reflect on what you've done, just about two hours, although 
some people need four, I think in your case;-) is enough with five.

7. Type 'ssmss' and ...
