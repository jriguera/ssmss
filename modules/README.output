	Output.pm   v 0.10 (c) Enero 2003 José Riguera <j.riguera@gmx.net>

Example module/extension/plugin which shows the operation of the modules 
with the program 'ssmss', also serves as a template to develop new modules.

Installation:

Simply copy the file Output.pm to the directory where the modules are, 
usually '~/.ssmss/modules', you only need read permissions.


If you are interested in seeing how the modules work, or you want to 
program one, ..., use the module called 'Output.pm'.  This module is an 
example so you can just fill the functions with the appropriate code and 
run it!. By the way, you will participate in a free software project. 
If you do not know how to become a programmer (in perl) but you want to
participate in the project, you can! ... What? ... Providing ideas, 
translating the messages into other languages, etc...
